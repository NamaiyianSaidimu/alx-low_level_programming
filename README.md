In this Repository, we take a look at how to write code in a low-level programming language. We will use C in this repository.
Some of the concepts explored in the projects in this repository include:
1) What happens when you type gcc main.c
2) What is main
3) How to print text using the printf, puts and putchar.
4) How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof.
5) How to compile a program using gcc.
