## C - Variables, If, Else, While

In this project, we look at:
  a) The different ways we can manipulate variables in C
  b) How to make decisions in C programming using If, If else, If...else        if...else
  c) How to epeatedly execute blocks of code in C using for loops, while loops and do...while loops.
  
### Below is a short description of what each program in this directory is designed to achieve.

#### 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The variable n will store a different value every time we run the program. 
The output of the program should be:
  + The number followed by:
    If the number is greater than 0, 'is positive'
    If the number is 0, 'is zero'
    If the number is less than 0, 'is negative'
  + Followed by a new line.

#### 1-last_digit.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The source code should print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The variable n will store a different value every time we run this program.
The output of the program should be:
  + The string "Last digit of", followed by
  + n, followed by
  + the string 'is', followed by
    If the last digit of n is greater than 5, the string 'and is greater than 5'
    If the last digit of n is 0, the string 'and is 0'
    If the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0, the string 'and is less than     6 and not 0'
  + followed by a new line.

#### 2-print_alphabet.c
This is a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  + We can only use the putchar function.
  + All out code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putchar twice in our code.
  
#### 3-print_alphabets.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
  + We can only use the putchar function.
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putcahr three times in our code.
  
#### 4-print_alphabt.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  + It should print all the letters except q and e
  + We can only use the putchar function.
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putchar twice in our code.

#### 5-print_numbers.c
This is a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  
#### 6-print_numberz.c
This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
  + We are not allowed to use any variable of type char
  + We can only use the putchar function
  + We can only use putchar twice in our code.
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  
#### 7-print_tebahpla.c
This is a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. 
  + We can only use the putchar function
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putchar twice in our code.
  
#### 8-print_base16.c
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  + We can only use the putchar function
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putchar three times in our code.
  
#### 9-print_comb.c
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
  + Numbers must be separated by ',' followed by a space
  + Numbers should be printed in ascending order.
  + We can only use the putchar function.
  + All our code should be in the main function.
  + We can only use putchar four times maximum in our code.
  + We are not allowed to use any variable of type char.
